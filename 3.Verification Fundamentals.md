### Verification Plan
>We need to create a sheet to wirte our Verification plan.  
>In the sheet, it includes  
>>1.testcase: which signal you want to test  
>>2.description: what the situation it is  
>>3.goal: what the correct result it is  

### Directed Test Vs. Constraint Random Test 
>1.Directed Test: Test each testcase one by one. It exists hidden bug that not tested.   
>2.Random Test: need to generate all random values and need infinite time.   
>3.Constraint Random Test: generate random values to cover all function coverage.  

### Architechtural layers

>1.Layer5: Control simulation until all the sequences -> DUT and Response -> DUT.  
>2.Layer4: Generate sequence to verify Specific Feature of DUT + checking response received against GD.  
>3.Layer3: Schedule individual command for specific sequence.  
>4.Layer2: Individual command -> Drive signal + Receive response -> command.  
>5.Layer1: DUT.

>Transaction: Contain variable for all the inputs/outputs port present in DUT tp share among classes.  
>Generater: Generate random stimulus and send it to driver using **IPC**.  
>Driver: Receive stimulus from generater and trigger respective signals of DUT with help of **INTERFACE**.  
>Monitor: Receive Response from DUT and send it to Scoreboard using **IPC**.  
>Scoreboard: Compare response of DUT with GD.   
>Environment: Hold GEN,DRV,MON,SCO together.  
>Test: Hold Env and Control simulation process.
