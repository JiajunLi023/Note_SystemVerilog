### Verification Plan
>We need to create a sheet to wirte our Verification plan.  
>In the sheet, it includes  
>>1.testcase: which signal you want to test  
>>2.description: what the situation it is  
>>3.goal: what the correct result it is  

### Directed Test Vs. Constraint Random Test 
>1.Directed Test: Test each testcase one by one. It exists hidden bug that not tested.   
>2.Random Test: need to generate all random values and need infinite time.   
>3.Constraint Random Test: generate random values to cover all function coverage.
