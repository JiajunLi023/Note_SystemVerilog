### How to define an interface and connect it to DUT?
>1.Firstly generate a interface object
```
interface add_if();
  logic [3:0] a;
  logic [3:0] b;
  logic [4:0] c;
endinterface
```
>2. Use it in module and create object of DUT in module, too
```
/////DUT
module and4 (
  input [3:0] a,
  input [3:0] b,
  output [3:0] y
 
);
  
 assign y = a & b; 
endmodule

///////Testbench
module tb();
  add_if aif;
  
  and4 dut(.a(aif.a), .b(aif.b), .c(aif.c)). //initial by value name
  ///or and4 dut(aif.a, aif.b, aif.c) //initial by position
  
  initial begin
    aif.a = 4'b0100;
    aif.b = 4'b1100;
    #10;
    $display("a : %b , b : %b and y : %b",aif.a, aif.b, aif.y );
  end
  
endmodule
```

### What is the difference of blocking and non blocking ?
>1. Blocking: =, after finishing this operation we can do next operations.  
>2. Non-blocking : <=, though this operation has not been finished, the next operation can also be operated.    

### Why we prefer logic type than reg or wire tyoe?
>1.If we use reg type, we are not allowed to connext variable in interface to the output port in DUT.   
>2.If we use wire typo, we are not allowed to apply stimuli in initial or always block.(wire type only allows continuous assignment)
